      summary: Delete V P C Association Authorization
      description: Removes authorization to submit an AssociateVPCWithHostedZone request
        to associate a specified VPC with a hosted zone that was created by a different
        account. You must use the account that created the hosted zone to submit a
        DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization request.ImportantSending this request only
        prevents the AWS account that created the VPC from associating the VPC with
        the Amazon Route 53 hosted zone in the future. If the VPC is already associated
        with the hosted zone, DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorization won't disassociate
        the VPC from the hosted zone. If you want to delete an existing association,
        use DisassociateVPCFromHostedZone.Send a DELETE request to the /2013-04-01/hostedzone/hosted
        zone ID/deauthorizevpcassociation resource. The request body must include
        a document with a DeleteVPCAssociationAuthorizationRequest element.
